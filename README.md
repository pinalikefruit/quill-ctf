## About the QuillCTF

QuillCTF are competitions organized to hone and test the proficiency and expertise of information security professionals. In this CTF, participants are tasked with analyzing and auditing a smart contract and its related functions. 

Web3 CTFs will teach you about Ethereum, Solidity, EVM, DeFi, and other interesting aspects of the Web3 ecosystem.


## Challenge

üìå QuillCTF is a game in which you hack Ethereum smart contracts to learn about security. It's meant to be both fun and educational. The game is designed to educate players on identifying and fixing security issues in Ethereum smart contracts.

üìå The challenges contain several of the most common vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts today, including reentrancy, integer overflows/underflows, predictable randomness, and more!

üìå Finally, there is also a leaderboard to track user progress and compare results. This encourages users to keep pushing themselves and striving to be the best.


## What will you find here?

This section will be to discover various aspects that each challenge includes so that you can complete it on your own.

You could call it as a complement to these challenges, although I will present the solution, it is not to go immediately for the solution, it is to explain what terms and concepts are involved, go deeper and understand what we are doing.

This will be the dynamic for each challenge:

- Complementary information to solve the challenge
- Extra help
- Solution explained

> Remember, this is just one way to solve it, there are many ways, feel comfortable and do it the way you think is right, make mistakes, try, but never give up.
